I am a PhD student at [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), NUS, under guidance of [Prof. Divesh Aggrawal](https://sites.google.com/site/diveshhomepage/) and [Prof. Maciej Obremski](https://sites.google.com/view/maciejobremski). Prior to that, I obtained master's degree in Computer Science (2022-'24) and bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science (2019-'22) from [Chennai Mathematical Insitute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). During my masters, I was fortunate to have [Prof. Amit Kumar Sinhababu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BddOgm0AAAAJ&hl=en) as my thesis advisor.
